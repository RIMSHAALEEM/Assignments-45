/* Question:
Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and 
a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information
 and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the 
 information was stored correctly.

  const carInfo = {
    manufacturer,

  }

let result = storeCarInfo("Honda" , "Civic" , {color:'Black'} , {features: ['Navigation' , 'Power Window'] });
