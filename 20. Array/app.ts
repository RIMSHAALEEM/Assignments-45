/* 
Question:
Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a 
list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d 
like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items. */

//Method 1 to store values in an array
let items :string[] = ['Hyderabad', 'Karachi' , 'English'] ;
console.log(items);



//another method 2 to store values in an empty array
//write a program that creates a list containing these items

let item2 :string[] = [];

item2.push('Germany');//will be printed on index [0]
item2.push('Itaky');//will be printed on index [1]
item2.push('Srilanka');//will be printed on index [2]

console.log(item2);
